# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

Customising BNT-1 
-The design choice for btn-1 was to make use of hover and change of color text adding, applying color as well as making the 'click here' change color to creat an interative buttons  also adding text shadow 

- The changes that l faced was that at first my codes were not working together so l had to erase them and try again

I am proud that l was able to bring my vision into live for the first button and create something simple yet appealing to the eye.

BTN-2 
- The design choice for btn-2 was to add translation to the hover and change color when the hover happens and making the 'click here' change color and add text-shadow.

- l am proud that l achieved a different and more creative button with btn-2 

- l faced no challanges as l am understanding more how the css properties and how l make them work together
